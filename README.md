# hangman-app - A simple word puzzle app made entirely in JavaScript

This project is a simple word puzzle game. I worked through this project to brush up on my vanilla JavaScript skills, particularly making API calls, using promises, manipulating the DOM and using event listeners.

For this project, I used Webpack which is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser.

I also integrated Babel in order to practise compiling and simplifying code so that the app would work on different browsers.

This is a project I completed as part of Andrew Mead's 'The Modern Javascript Course' on Udemy. This was a 30 hour project to learn and practise the fundamental parts of JavaScript.
